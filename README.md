# Portfolio_Update

This is a website portfolio made by Paul Atienzo to showcase his new abilities and skills as a web developer he gained from his time at the University of Arizona Boot Camp. This started as an assignment from the bootcamp and will turn into a completed Portfolio that will be used professionally as the time goes on.

Also updated with new improvements.
